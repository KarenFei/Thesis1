			<h4>Analyzing and Understanding Cultural Differences</h4>
			<div class="hover-shown">
				Culture is more than arts, it is a framework to our lives. It affects our values, attitudes and behavior. On the other hand we are actors in our culture and affect it. According to Levo-Henriksson (1994), culture covers the everyday way of life as well as myths and value systems of society. Roos (1986) sees culture as a system of lifestyles and as a common dominator for lifestyles. Lifestyle reveals culture that is large and stiff wholeness, uniform, regular and like-minded in our lives. Lifestyles is a possible way to outline one's life within the framework of culture.

			According to Adler (1997, 15-16), culture, values, attitudes and behaviors in a society influence each other. Values can be defined as factors that are explicitly or implicitly desirable and that affects our decisions. Values do not need to be conscious, they can be also unconsious. The values we have are based on our culture. Attitudes express values and get us to act or to react in a certain way toward something. Attitudes are always there when people act even if they do not see them. There is no action without attitudes. Behavior can be described to be any form of human action. The behavior of individuals and groups influence the society's culture. There is no culture in the society without people's behavior.

<h2>Nature of People</h2>
<p>There are differences in cultures with respect to beliefs about the nature of people, that is, people may be seen as good or evil or both. Although it rather usual, at least in western societies, to see people as a mixture of good and evil, it also rather usual for people to fear the unknown. Thus, people may assume foreigners (who are unknown to them) to be evil people. (Adler, 1997.)
Finnish people are supposed to be modest and not talk about themselves. This aspect of the culture is illustrated by the Finnish saying "Modesty makes beautiful". If a Finn is praised a lot, he becomes suspicious and cautious. Emotions run deep in a Finn and do not often come out. Negative emotions are expressed more often than positive ones. It is accepted to feel negatively; when you expect the worse, you cannot be disappointed. (Keltinkangas-Järvinen, 1996.)
<br><br>
In Sami culture individuals are seen as a mixture of good and evil. Myths and shamanism is an important part of Sami culture. (Pentikäinen, 1995.)
<br><br>
North Carolinians are very religious. They have developed fierce loyalties to family, their land, and church. Of course there are differences between people and regions but usually North Carolinians take pride of something simply because it represents North Carolina (Roberts, 1973).
<br><br>
Cherokee Indians are also very religious. Outsiders have known Cherokees as warlords of the southern mountains but among themselves they were Principal People. In history Cherokees warred on their neighbors. However, when the white men arrived, the Cherokee began to make treaties with them. (Norman, 1995.)

<h3>Relation to the external environment</h3>
<p id="right">There are differences in cultures with respect to people's relationships to the external environment. In some cultures people dominate over their environment. In some cultures people can live in harmony with their environment and do not see any real separation between people and nature. In other cultures people are subjugated by the environment and people accept the inevitable forces of nature. (Adler, 1997.) Cultures obviously differ today widely in how they value their technological environment and the role of information technology.<br><br>
The old Finnish saying "If God is willing and the weather permits", illustrates the Finns' relationship to the environment and nature. In Finland, the climate has set rules to sources of livelihood. When agriculture was the main industry, people's lives were a struggle against weather conditions. Today many persons' livelihoods today still depend on forestry and paper industries. Although Finns try to dominate nature, they also know that forces of nature are too powerful to be completely dominated by them. Today Finns value information technology and believe it to help them in the Information society (On the Road, 1997.)
<br><br>
Sami people want to live in harmony with the nature. Their way of life does not deprivate or destroy the nature. The Sami people believe the stories that there are earth spirits living underground, so people should not pour hot water on the ground in order not to disturb there earth spirits (Aikio et al., 1996). According to Sami culture there are also other kinds of spirits living in nature, and nature itself should be considered holy.
<br><br>
North Carolinians have tried to find a balance between agriculture and industry. They have also made many efforts to protect nature already for a long time. Around 1885, North Carolina established soil conservation in North Carolina; and in 1911 the state acquired the headwaters of certain rivers to protect the drinking water. On several occasions, the people have acted in accordance with the state's long-standing respect for nature and the environment. Information technology has a important role in North Carolina as in everywhere in the United States as a part of National Information Infrastructure.
<br><br>
Historically, the Cherokee have lived off the land. The women gathered fruits and berries, and the men herded bison for meat. The women also started agrigulture when they learnt to till the soil and plant the best seeds for the crop yield. As the Cherokees began to settle into camp sites, they located their villages on the banks of good-size stream that had good fish and fresh water. Cherokees had mystical ceremonies. For example, the Cherokees celebrated the planting of the corn; the first roasting ear time; and the full ripe time of the corn. (Underwood, 1961).

<h2>Relation to other people</h2>
<p>There are differences in cultures with respect to how people see a person's relationship to other people. In some cultures, people are individualistists and use personal characteristics and achievements to define themselves and value individual welfare. In other cultures people are group-oriented and define themselves as members of groups, which can be clans or communities. In these cultures people consider common goals and the groups's welfare most important. (Adler, 1997.)
Traditionally, especially in the eastern part of Finland collectivism has been strong. People had to work together as a family and with neighbours. (Siikala, 1996.) Today urbanisation has broken the sense of collectivism. As people moved to cities, mostly in the 60's and 70's, they tried to continue the habit of joint activities. After the first years it decreased to a minimum. (Kortteinen, 1982.) Today collectivism has changed to individualism.
<br><br>
Sami people are group-oriented; families and communality are strong. A family spirit has an important role in the education of children. Sami people are also seen as withdrawn and silent people who do not necessarily want to approach an outsider and who often fear and escape people who are unknown to them (Itkonen, 1984.)
<br><br>
On the one hand, North Carolinians have sought to impose order and predictability by developing fierce loyalties to family, church, and local community. (Crow and Tise, 1979.) Among North Carolinians there is a strong feeling of kinship. On the other hand, North Carolinians can be seen also as individualistists. They object to being told by anyone what to do or not to do. (Powell, 1988). They are generous and eager to be helpful, but they also expect in turn favours, not words, for thanks. (Roberts, 1973.)
<br><br>
Cherokee Indians are group-oriented. Their social structure includes seven clans. The Cherokees held others in respect, especially the women, who had as much to say about the tribe as anyone and who participated in various types of ceremonies (Underwood, 1961).

<h3 id="p4">How do people see space</h3>
<p id="right2">There are differences in cultures with respect to people's idea from physical space. Various cultures have different opinions whether the space should be seen public or private. (Adler, 1997.)
Both private and public spaces are important for Finns. On the one hand, home is a private place, where Finns can be safe and do what and how they want to do. The respect of owning land has been strong. On the other hand, it is important for Finns to be able to wander in forests and go for fishing to lakes. The law gives every man's rights to everybody to use forests and lakes without ownership.
<br><br>
Space is public in Sami culture. People have rights to the land but they do not have to own it. Understanding land and space as private is not known by Sami people traditionally.
<br><br>
North Carolinians obtain deeds to their property and can sell it. Rural North Carolinians enjoy the open spaces of farms and rural countryside. For the heavily populated areas many North Carolinians take great pride in ownership of houses. However, many developers are required to leave open green spaces for recreation and parkways in new developments; most towns and cities have community parks and green ways for public walking and biking.
<br><br>
Cherokees living on the Reservation only have possessory rights to the tracts. They cannot sell any part of the land on the reservation without the permission of the Cherokee council and the president of the United Sates. Cherokees living in remote villages and isolated communities in the mountain counties can own and resell their property. The Cherokee Indians continue to appreciate the big outdoors by running campgrounds for tourists, operating parks and trails, and fishing.

<h2 id="lastt">Difference in language <br>&<br> communication styles</h2>
<p id="lastp">Although Adler (1997) does not mention language and communication styles as a dimension of cultural differences, it obvious that they are one major way in which cultures and groups within major cultures vary (Gudykunst, 1986; Tannen, 1990). Although people may be able to speak the same language they could understand and interpret words differently, because the same words may mean different things to various persons. There are differences in shading and nuance of words (Reed, 1986).
Differences in language and communication styles became evident to our class during the course. The course was organized in English, which was the native language of the students in Chapel Hill, but a foreign language to the students in Oulu. This was not, however, a big problem in the class. Students were able to communicate and collaborate in English. Finns have become used to using a foreign language when collaborating with others.
<br><br>
In the class we were able to learn that there are differences in spoken and unspoken languages between Finns and North Carolinians. Finns are known as silent people. They do not usually use small talk. In Finland it is desirable to keep silent and not to speak too much. (Lehtonen & Sajavaara, 1985.) Instead, the silent language is not common to most North Carolinians. They tend to speak to almost everyone they meet and make small talk. Saville-Troike (1985) points out that there are different norms of appropriateness for speaking and remaining silent, which can cause misunderstanding in cross-cultural communication. Lehtonen and Sajavaara (1985, p. 199) describe the role of talk and silence: "Cross-cultural differences in the uses of talk and silence clearly exists. Americans ask questions and forces others to talk to fill up interactional silence, because silence is not tolerated socially. In many cases, the function of talk among Americans is not in transference of information or messages, but in the avoidance of silence."
<br><br>
During our videoconferences both Finnish and American students participated and discussed in a very active way and Finnish and American students in the project groups contacted each other regularly. However we were able to get some evidence of the silent Finns in a very interesting way. We had a common electronic discussion board where various topics were discussed. Some messages sent to the discussion board were course-related topics, e.g. ideas for projects and information about useful links. Many messages which were posted to the discussion board were, however, interpersonal communication, or small talk, about various topics like Valintine's Day, President Clinton's visit to Helsinki etc. Students in Chapel Hill were more eager to send messages to the discussion board than students in Oulu. A total of 128 messages were posted to the discussion board during the semester, 80 messages were sent by students in Chapel Hill and only 12 by students in Oulu. 36 messages were posted by instructors. We suppose that small talk is difficult for Finns also in electronically.
